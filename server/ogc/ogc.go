// Package ogc serves the OGC API - Tiles surface: a landing page, a
// conformance declaration, collections, tilesets, tiles, and the tiling schemes
// they are cut in.
//
// It is additive to tegola's native routes, which keep serving the same tiles at
// the same URLs. The one thing it takes over is "/", the landing page's required
// location, which displaces the embedded viewer to /viewer (ADR-0003).
//
// The package deliberately does not import tegola/server: the server mounts this
// surface, so the dependency runs one way. Everything this package needs from
// its host — where the service is reachable, what it is mounted under, which
// atlas to read — arrives in Config.
